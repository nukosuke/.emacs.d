      - [ ] yasnippet
      - [ ] avy

      - [ ] git-gutter hunk operations
        - Create transient command and add it to magit-dispatch transient
    - [ ] Use SKK

*** Bugs
    - [ ] Fix this: exec-path-from-shell
      #+begin_src console
      You appear to be setting environment variables ("PATH") in your .bashrc or .zshrc: those files are only read by interactive shells, so you should instead set environment variables in startup files like .profile, .bash_profile or .zshenv.  Refer to your shell’s man page for more info.  Customize ‘exec-path-from-shell-arguments’ to remove "-i" when done, or disable ‘exec-path-from-shell-check-startup-files’ to disable this message.
      #+end_src

** Not planned yet
   - [ ] Create transient commands for frequently used packages.
   - [ ] Refresh diff marker of git-gutter-fringe after magit stage
     - Need to research magit hooks
   - [ ] Refresh branch name in modeline after magit operation and counsel-checkout.
